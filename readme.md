**Objective of two objects**:
The objective of two objects is like a circle and square and to learn how to relate and understand how objects connect with each other in real life. Their behavior is almost the same but are not the same objects. These two objects will be very helpful to understand and it works as a beginner of different kinds of programming languages.


**What I have learned**
I learned that a class in Java is a logical template to create multiple objects that share common properties and method.
I also have learned null and how to use null in the array. As we know, how to use conditions like && and || and so on. Especially, when I try to use null as a condition. I found that there is some creativity  needed which condition go first (&&). Really learned good techniques for  null Exception.  
New things I also learned that This.  when I can use it.
